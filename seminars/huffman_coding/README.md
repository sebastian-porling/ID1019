# Seminar 1 - Huffman coding

In this seminar we are going to make huffman coding using elixir.
We will start by make the frequency from a samle text that is just a few paragrahfs.
We will then use a bigger text file that we will use for the frequency as well encode and decode.

## Morse

We got an assignment where we were supposed to decode morsecode. 
Using a decode table that were given to us.
